# TechieButlerAssignmentApp Demo

I write this application as an assignemt given by the Techie Butler and the requirement was to create a app to demonstrates fetching data from a public API endpoint and presenting it in a paginated list format. It also includes basic optimization techniques for efficient rendering and data management.

## Features

- Data fetching from a public API endpoint with support for pagination.
- Displaying fetched data in a UITableView component with pagination.
- Each list item presents the fetched data, including the `id` and `title` fields.
- Implementation of pagination to fetch and display data in batches, enhancing user experience and optimizing performance.
- Loading more data as the user scrolls through the list.
- Basic heavy computation optimization (placeholder for further optimization).
- Passing necessary data from the selected item to the detailed view using segues.
- Employing memorization of callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-computation or re-rendering.
